 * use an already compiled tree
 * build the package by your self for generate a valid tree
 * copy ```wp-upcloo`` folder into your production env
 
If you copy all resource all system works fine without any improvements 
or performance reduction. Only the natural package is quite verbose
respect a compiled one. That because the UpCloo have tests, packages
and all other development stuffs.
