 * build the package by your self for generate a valid tree
 * copy ```wp-upcloo`` folder into your production env

If you copy all resource all system works fine without any improvements
or performance reduction. Only the natural package is quite verbose
respect a compiled one. That because the UpCloo have tests, packages
and all other development stuffs.
