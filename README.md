## Build and distribuite

For distribuite this WordPress plugin you have three options:

 * use an already compiled tree [Download area](/upcloo/upcloo-wordpress-plugin/downloads)
 * build the package by your self for generate a valid tree
 * copy ```wp-upcloo`` folder into your production env

If you copy all resource all system works fine without any improvements
or performance reduction. Only the natural package is quite verbose
respect a compiled one. That because the UpCloo have tests, packages
and all other development stuffs.

### Building library

Build is supported by Ant file "build.xml" and is very simple to use

Compile the project with ```ant```. If you want to clean your
project use ```ant clean```.

After compile process you have a new directory named ```dist``` that
have only necessary stuffs for WordPress. Now open this one and
you can copy the ```wp-upcloo``` folder directly into your ```wp-content/plugins``` .

### Subtrees

In order to use SVN split plugin folder to another repository

```
git subtree split --prefix=wp-upcloo --annotate='(READONLY) ' -b wp-upcloo
git push https://github.com/upcloo/upcloo-wordpress-plugin-single.git wp-upcloo:master
```
